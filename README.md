# Highlight Hunt - Sequence Memory Game üéÆ

A dynamic memory game built with the MERN stack that challenges players to remember and reproduce sequences of highlighted cells in an expanding grid. The game features progressive difficulty levels, quick-flash patterns, and a global leaderboard.

## Features üåü

### Core Game Mechanics
- **Progressive Grid System**: 
  - 3x3 grid (0-4 score) with 3 sequence patterns
  - 4x4 grid (5-9 score) with 4 sequence patterns
  - 5x5 grid (10+ score) with 5 sequence patterns

- **Quick-Flash Patterns**: Rapid sequence display mechanism for enhanced challenge
- **Real-time Score Tracking**: Instant score updates and game state management
- **Global Leaderboard**: Top 10 high scores displayed
- **Smooth Animations**: Enhanced user experience with clean transitions
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on various screen sizes

### Technical Features
- Full MERN stack implementation
- RESTful API for score management
- Custom React hooks for game state
- Tailwind CSS for modern styling
- MongoDB for persistent data storage
